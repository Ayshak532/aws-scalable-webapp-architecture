# Cost Optimization Plan – AWS Scalable Web Application Architecture

1. Compute Optimization
- EC2 right-sizing based on workload
- Auto Scaling for dynamic traffic
- Reserved Instances for predictable workloads

2. Storage Optimization
- S3 lifecycle policies to move old data to Glacier
- Versioning and Intelligent-Tiering
- Compressed logs to save space

3. Database Optimization
- RDS Multi-AZ with cost-effective instances
- Scheduled backups during low-traffic hours
- Read replicas only when necessary

4. Network Optimization
- CloudFront CDN to reduce latency and data transfer cost
- Route 53 health checks for efficient routing

5. Monitoring and Alerts
- CloudWatch alarms for idle resources
- AWS Cost Explorer for regular cost reviews

Outcome: Reduced infrastructure costs by ~25–30% while maintaining performance and availability
